🎨 Data Visualization with Matplotlib

Welcome to the Data Visualization section of the Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis repo! 🚀
Here, we transform plain numbers into beautiful charts and graphs using Matplotlib.

If you’re just starting out with Python and Data Science, this folder is your first step into visual storytelling. 📊✨

📂 Folder Contents
📘 Data Visualization Part 1.ipynb

Focus: Basics of Plotting

Importing libraries: matplotlib, numpy

Creating arrays of numbers with NumPy

Drawing your first line plot

Understanding how data flows from numbers → graph

💡 Think of this notebook as your "Hello World!" of data visualization.

📘 Data Visualization Part 2.ipynb

Focus: Styling & Customization

Changing line colors and line styles

Making plots more readable and attractive

Exploring how styling affects data interpretation

Hands-on examples with variations

💡 Here, you learn to add “makeup” to your plots so they don’t just inform—they impress!

🛠️ Tools You’ll Use
Tool	Purpose
Python 🐍	Programming language
NumPy 🔢	Handling numbers & arrays

✨ Why This Matters

Data visualization is the bridge between numbers and people.
Without visuals, data is just raw numbers. With visuals, data becomes a story everyone can understand.

This folder helps you build that bridge step by step. 🌉
