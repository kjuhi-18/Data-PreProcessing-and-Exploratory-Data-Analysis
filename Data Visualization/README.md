🎨 Data Visualization with Matplotlib

Welcome to the Data Visualization section of the Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis repo! 🚀
Here, we transform plain numbers into beautiful charts and graphs using Matplotlib.

If you’re just starting out with Python and Data Science, this folder is your first step into visual storytelling. 📊✨

📂 Folder Contents
📘 Data Visualization Part 1.ipynb

👉 Focus: Basics of Plotting

Importing libraries: matplotlib, numpy.

Creating arrays of numbers with NumPy.

Drawing your first line plot.

Understanding how data flows from numbers → graph.

💡 Think of this notebook as your "Hello World!" of data visualization.

📘 Data Visualization Part 2.ipynb

👉 Focus: Styling & Customization

Changing line colors and line styles.

Making plots more readable and attractive.

Exploring how styling affects the way we interpret data.

Hands-on examples with variations.

💡 Here, you learn to add “makeup” to your plots so they don’t just inform, they impress!

🛠️ Tools You’ll Use

Python 🐍 → the programming language.

NumPy 🔢 → for handling numbers & arrays.

Matplotlib 📊 → for creating charts.

Jupyter Notebook 📓 → interactive environment to run and test code.

👩‍🎓 Who is this for?

This folder is designed for:
✅ Beginners who are new to Data Visualization.
✅ Students starting with Data Science.
✅ Anyone curious about how data turns into pictures that tell stories.

🚀 How to Get Started

Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-preprocessing-and-exploratory-data-analysis.git


Navigate to this folder

cd data-preprocessing-and-exploratory-data-analysis/Data Visualization


Open Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook


Open the .ipynb files and run the cells step by step.

🌟 What You’ll Learn

🔹 How to import and use libraries.
🔹 How to create data arrays with NumPy.
🔹 How to make your first plots in Matplotlib.
🔹 How to style plots with colors, line types, and more.

📊 Example Visuals

Here’s a sneak peek of what you’ll create:

The same plot but styled with different colors and line types 🎨

(You can even add screenshots of your own plots here for extra visual appeal on GitHub!)

✨ Why This Matters

Data visualization is the bridge between numbers and people.
Without visuals, data is just raw numbers. With visuals, data becomes a story everyone can understand.

This folder helps you build that bridge step by step. 🌉
