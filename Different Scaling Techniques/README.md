🔄 Different Scaling Techniques

Welcome to the Different Scaling Techniques folder of the Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis repo! 🎉
Here, you’ll learn about two of the most important preprocessing steps in machine learning:

✨ Min-Max Scaling
✨ Standard Scaling

Both are explained in detail inside the Jupyter Notebook Different Scaling.ipynb, with beginner-friendly explanations and visuals.

🤔 Why Scale Data?

Imagine comparing two scores:

🏀 Basketball → 20 points

🤸 Gymnastics → 9.8 points

Directly comparing them is unfair because they’re on different scales.
The same happens with features like age (20–60) and salary (20,000–200,000).

⚠️ Without scaling → models can get biased toward larger values
✅ With scaling → all features are treated equally ⚖️

1️⃣ Min-Max Scaler (Normalization) 📏

Compresses data into a fixed range (usually 0 to 1)

Formula:

𝑋
𝑠
𝑐
𝑎
𝑙
𝑒
𝑑
=
𝑋
−

𝑚

X−X

✅ Best for: when you need values within a defined range

⚠️ Watch out: very sensitive to outliers

2️⃣ Standard Scaler (Standardization) 🎯

Reshapes data so that:

Mean (μ) = 0

Standard Deviation (σ) = 1

Formula:

𝑋
𝑠
𝑐
𝑎
𝑙
𝑒
𝑑
=
𝑋
−

✅ Best for: when data has different scales & you want to reduce the effect of outliers

💡 Commonly used in algorithms that assume normal distribution

🚀 Why This Matters

Scaling is a core step in preprocessing that ensures every feature contributes fairly to your machine learning model.

🔑 Takeaway:

Min-Max → keeps values in a fixed range

Standard Scaler → centers & normalizes data for robustness
