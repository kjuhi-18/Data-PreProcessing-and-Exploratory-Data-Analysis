🚢 Data Wrangling

Welcome to the Data Wrangling section!
Here, we use the Titanic dataset to learn the basics of cleaning, organizing, and exploring data step by step.

❓ What is Data Wrangling?

Data Wrangling (also called Data Cleaning or Data Munging) is the process of:

🧹 Cleaning messy data (fixing missing values, errors, or duplicates)

🏗️ Transforming raw data into a structured format

🔍 Exploring data to find patterns and insights

👉 In simple words:
It’s like washing and preparing vegetables before cooking a meal.
Just as clean and prepared ingredients make cooking easier, clean and organized data makes analysis and machine learning more effective.

📂 What’s Inside

📓 Data Wrangling.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with code and explanations

📑 Titanic.csv → Dataset of Titanic passengers

🗂️ The Titanic Dataset

This dataset is about passengers aboard the Titanic and is one of the most famous datasets for practicing data analysis.

It has 891 passengers and 12 features:

🆔 PassengerId → Unique ID of each passenger

💡 Survived → Survival status (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)

🎟️ Pclass → Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

👤 Name → Full name of the passenger

🚻 Gender → Male / Female

🎂 Age → Age in years

👨‍👩‍👦 SibSp → Number of siblings/spouses aboard

👪 Parch → Number of parents/children aboard

🎫 Ticket → Ticket number

💵 Fare → Fare paid

🛏️ Cabin → Cabin number (if available)

⚓ Embarked → Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

✨ This dataset is perfect for beginners because it’s simple, yet full of interesting insights to explore.

📘 What the Notebook Covers

The notebook walks you through:

1️⃣ Getting Started

Importing Python libraries (pandas, numpy)

Loading the Titanic dataset

2️⃣ First Look at the Data

Checking the shape (rows & columns)

Viewing the first few records

Finding data types of each column

3️⃣ Describing the Data

Summarizing numbers (average age, fare, etc.)

Checking distributions of passengers

4️⃣ Visualizing Data

📊 Histogram of Male vs Female passengers

📊 Histogram of Age distribution

5️⃣ Digging Deeper

Counting passengers by Class (Pclass)

Checking survival counts by Gender

Exploring grouped data (e.g., survival by class and gender)

🎯 What You’ll Learn

By the end of this notebook, you’ll be able to:

✔️ Read and explore a dataset in Python

✔️ Summarize information using simple commands

✔️ Create quick visualizations to see patterns

✔️ Understand how groups (like gender or class) affect outcomes

🌟 Why This Is Useful

Data wrangling is the first step in any data science project.
It teaches you how to:

Handle messy data

Ask the right questions

Find meaningful patterns

Get your dataset ready for deeper analysis and machine learning

✨ With this notebook, you’ll take your first steps into the world of data analysis — starting from raw Titanic passenger data and turning it into valuable insights.
