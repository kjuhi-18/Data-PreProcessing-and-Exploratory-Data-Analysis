# 📊 Basic EDA — Demographic Data Exploration  

Welcome to the **Basic EDA** folder of the **Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis** repo! 🎉  
This mini-project is all about **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** — where we turn raw demographic numbers into **stories and insights**. 🚀  

Inside this folder, you’ll find:  
- 📝 **`Basic EDA.ipynb`** → a beginner-friendly Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step explanations  
- 📂 **`DemographicData.csv`** → the dataset we’ll explore

## 🌍 The Data: What Are We Looking At?  

The dataset contains information about countries around the world. Each row includes:  

- **Country Name** → The name of the country  
- **Country Code** → A short code for each country  
- **Birth rate** → Number of babies born per 1,000 people  
- **Internet users** → Number of internet users per 100 people  
- **Income Group** → Income classification (e.g., High, Middle, or Low income)  

Our journey starts by loading this into a **pandas DataFrame** (a super-powered spreadsheet 📊) to make analysis smooth and fun.

## 📓 The Data Detective’s Notebook  

The notebook (`Basic EDA.ipynb`) guides you step by step:  

1. 🔍 **First Look at the Data**  
   - Use `.head()` and `.info()` to peek at the first few rows and understand the dataset’s structure.  

2. 🧹 **Spring Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values by:  
     - Dropping incomplete rows (`.dropna()`)  
     - Filling gaps with placeholders (`.fillna(0)`)  

3. ✨ **Making It Readable**  
   - Rename columns for clarity (e.g., `"Internet users"` → `"Internet Users"`).  

4. 🔢 **Data Makeover**  
   - Create a new **Income Level** column by assigning numbers to income groups (1, 2, 3, 4).  

5. 📊 **Finding the Story in Numbers**  
   - Use `.describe()` to summarize numerical data: averages, min, max, and spread.  

6. 🎯 **Filtering Fun**  
   - Easily filter rows (e.g., show only “High income” countries).  

7. 🎨 **Plotting a Masterpiece**  
   - Scatter plot: **Birth Rate vs. Internet Usage**  
   - Dots colored by **Income Group**, showing patterns between economy, internet use, and population growth.
